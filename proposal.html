        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Existing single ski resort websites lack features tailored to the unique needs of skiers, such as the ability to compare multiple resorts side by side, track visit history, or coordinate trips with friends or family members. Our core idea is to create a platform where skiers can access and upload information about ski resorts and make plans to visit (like a ski reminder). Such a platform would not only help skiers make informed decisions about where and when to ski, what kind of ski board they should bring which works as a reminder for users.

            Other websites such as <a href="https://www.skiresort.info/comparison/">skiresort.info</a> try to address similar problems. We will gather some features from existing ski resort websites, but composing them in a straightforward way.
